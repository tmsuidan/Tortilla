# Tortilla translucense and overpressed analysis
A python script to assess translucent and over pressed percent and area on a tortilla

Requirements:
python version 3.10.5
opencv version 4.6.0
Pandas version 1.4.3

This script was created to assess the percent and area of translucence and overpressing of Taco Bell tortillas. The thresholds are based on the lab lighting of a particular facility and would need adjustment or standardization of equipment for mass use.
A 12MP camera was used.

Sample pictures are in the images directory and would need to be renamed (removing the digit).
